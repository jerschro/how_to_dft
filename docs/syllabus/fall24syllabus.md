## Grading Procedures

Final Grade Distribution:

* 50% of final grade is for reports.

* Attend Dr. Aquino's group meeting.
* Meet/Check in with Jeremy or Dr. Aquino.
* Keep up with calculations/semester report and ask for help when you have questions.
* Complete and show Jeremy or Dr. Aquino the assignment of the week.

The weekly grade will be on a scale of 0-3. For every meeting not attended without a legitimate reason, 1 point will be deducted from the weekly grade.

* 0: Means you did not do any work from last week.
* 1: Some progress was done.
* 2: Considerable progress was achieved but not adequate enough for the expectations given.
* 3: Everything was completed that was asked. Attended both meetings.
