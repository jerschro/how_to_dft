# Log on For Windows Devices

## Instructions to Log On for the First Time

1. Make sure you are on the wifi network TTUNet. If you are off campus, look at the [VPN Instructions](connect_to_vpn.md) to be able to log in.
1. Open the Terminal Program, I prefer Mobaxterm.
1. Type command in the terminal "ssh eraider@login.hpcc.ttu.edu" where eraider is your eraider account name.
    * If you are on mobaxterm, you can go to Session > New Session > SSH. Type login.hpcc.ttu.edu in Remote Host. Click specify username and type your eraider account name. Click OK. This will save your profile and you can just click on the session to login for future times.
1. You are now on the super computer!
1. Go to [Intro to the Terminal](intro_to_terminal.md) to learn how to interact with it!


## Recommended Software to download locally on Windows

In order to do our research correctly we need different categories of programs.
We need a visualization software to be able to see the molecular models.
We need a good text editor to be able to see the output files of the DFT programs.
For Windows, we need to download a program that contains a terminal (Windows PowerShell does not count).
We also need a file transfer program; MobaXterm has it built in or you can download WinSCP.
It is also a good idea to have a coding environment downloaded locally to be able to program.
