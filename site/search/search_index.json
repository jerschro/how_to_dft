If you want more resources go to the Extra Resources Heading</p> <p>Below is a list of basic linux commands. There are many more and this is just the few that is necessary to learn when first getting started.</p> <ul> <li><code>ls [path]</code> ls lists what is located in the directory path.</li> <li><code>cd [path]</code> cd changes the directory to the path desired.</li> <li><code>mkdir [folder name]</code> makes new directory with folder name as its name.</li> <li><code>nano [filename]</code> opens the file in the nano text editor. Go to Text Editors Heading for more info.</li> <li><code>mv [source path] [destination path]</code> moves the file from the source path to the destination path.

We have always interacted with paths on Windows and Mac but using GUI Operating Systems hides the path of files by being able to click on folders and visually seeing files. In the Terminal, we have to be very cognicent of the path of where files are because we cannot drag and drop to manipulate files, we have to use commands. </p> <p>There are three main ways to write a path to a file or directory. In Linux, paths always and only contain forward slashes <code>/</code> and the slashes seperate directory levels (Looking at you Windows). Lets say we want to access a file named lost_file.help in a subdirectory of our homedirectory named lost_jungle. There is another subdirectory of our homedirectory named pretty ocean with cool_file.nice located inside of it. Below is a visual representation of the example filestructure.</p> <pre><code>home\n|\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 the_eraider\n    |\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pretty_ocean\n    |   |\n    |   \u2514\u2500\u2500 cool_file.nice\n    |\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500lost_jungle\n        |\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 lost_file.help\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Full path: On the HPCC it would look something like this <code>/home/the_eraider/lost_jungle/lost_file.help</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Relative path: Lets say we are another subdirectory of our home directory named pretty_ocean because we were reading cool_file.nice. We can get to the lost file like this <code>../lost_jungle/lost_file.help</code>. The <code>../</code> means to go to the directory above the pwd also called the parent directory. </p> </li> <li> <p>Tilde path: Where ever we are in the filesystem, we can you the tilde ~ and it is short hand for our home directory.

It coincides after the creation and discovery of quantum mechanics because it is defined by quantum mechanics in some aspects. The Journal of Computational Chemistry was established in 1980. Now days, it is a very broad field of research with alot of different specific applications and methods.<sup>1</sup></p>"},{"location":"lessons/lesson_2/#branches-of-computational-chemistry","title":"Branches of Computational Chemistry","text":"<p>Below is a list of different branches of Computational Chemistry. Each branch has extensive research applications and very detailed definitions. The order of the list is from most computationally intense to least computationally intense.<sup>1</sup></p> <ul> <li> <p>Coupled Cluster Methods - These methods are used to calculate excited states in any size of system. This method is the most computationally intense because there are many different possible electronic orientations for any one excited electron in a system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) - It is the most computationally intense and complex way to model molecular interactions. There is no time scale and the scope of DFT is at the electron level. It uses fundamental and derived quantum mechanics principles to produce the results. This method is an Ab initio method and solves the Schr\u00f6dinger equation using equations and definitions that are derived directly from theory. Ab initio means in Latin \"from the beginning\" and these calculations do not require any experimental data as an input for the calculation. There are many approximations and it is the branch of computational chemistry we use in our research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Molecular Orbital (MO) or Hartree-Fock (HF) Theory - This method is also Ab initio method and is solved using Hartree-Fock Theory equations. It is a simplified version of DFT. At times it is slower than DFT and/or approaches a different answer than DFT but is less computationally intense overall than DFT.</p> </li> <li> <p>Molecular Dynamics - This method looks at forces between atoms and solves Newtonian equations or simplified quantum mechanics equations for atoms in a system. This type of modeling is used to \"simulate\" what happens at an atomistic level in real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monte Carlo - Is similar to Molecular Dynamics but uses sampling methods and configurations of systems to generate new configurations that possibly generate a lower energy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This picture shows a graph of Computational Chemistry Methods with Calculation Complexity vs Accuracy<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"lessons/lesson_2/#conclusions","title":"Conclusions","text":"<p>There are many different branches and complexities of computational chemistry.
